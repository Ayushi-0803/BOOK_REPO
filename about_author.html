                            Arayna Saxena was 14 years old and in 9th grade when she wrote this book.
                            She relishes writing poems that make the readers question their various experiences and have
                            a considerable influence on their thought process through the message of her poems. She also
                            likes to adopt distinct styles of poetry which the reader can find relatable in multiple
                            ways, and usually begins them with the description of a setting and the introduction of
                            characters to add personalization to the poem and aid the readers in their imagination.

                            the sword.

                            Poetry is something I was naturally inclined to as a form of expression. In 4th grade, my
                            Science teacher, Ms. Manbir Kaur, came in and said, “Students, you have been given an hour
                            to write poetry about a different meaning of light in your life.” I remember closing my eyes
                            and looking for my answer. For me, light symbolized positivity, hope, and aspirations. I
                            started penning it immediately. Manbir ma’am collected our piece of writings. Sometime
                            later, she called me in front of the class, read what I had written, and announced that the
                            teachers had selected it. She looked at me with a huge smile and said, “What you wrote was
                            overwhelming; I am so proud of you!”

                            In her eyes was pride, and this had been eternally imprinted in my brain as the day that
                            motivated me to discover my passions and work towards them to positively impact people
                            around me and feel proud of myself. Later, the school converted my poem into a song which
                            was sung at our annual function. This new experience encouraged me to continue exploring and
                            learning.

                            Throughout middle school, I received much support and inspiration for my academic pursuits,
                            literary skills, and extracurricular activities. I reached 9th grade in the middle of a
                            pandemic during which I became more observant of the people around me and the various
                            actions that drove them to feel any emotion. Soon I decided to write a book that would be a
                            collection of poetry that dealt with various themes so people anywhere in the world could
                            connect with my poems offering a change in perspective & support.

                            The entire process was indeed challenging, where I had to meet academic deadlines and, at

                            to now when she finally felt that her poems could be given a home in this book.
