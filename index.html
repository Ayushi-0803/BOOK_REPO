                            in the form of poetry with anyone who would listen. She has developed her storytelling
                            and
                            poetry writing skills since then, but the thrill of language and creation she first
                            discovered as a child has never gone away. She has been writing poems since she was in
                            4th
                            grade and has no intention of slowing down anytime soon. Get in touch if you’ve got any
                            comments, questions, suggestions, or just want to say hello. Arayna would be more than

                            a considerable influence on their thought process through the message of her poems. She also
                            likes to adopt distinct styles of poetry which the reader can find relatable in multiple
                            ways, and usually begins them with the description of a setting and the introduction of
                            characters to add personalization to the poem and aid the readers in their imagination.

                            Poetry is something I was naturally inclined to as a form of expression. In 4th grade, my
                            Science teacher, Ms. Manbir Kaur, came in and said, “Students, you have been given an hour
                            to write poetry about a different meaning of light in your life.” I remember closing my eyes
                            and looking for my answer. For me, light symbolized positivity, hope, and aspirations. I
                            started penning it immediately. Manbir ma’am collected our piece of writings. Sometime
                            later, she called me in front of the class, read what I had written, and announced that the
                            teachers had selected it. She looked at me with a huge smile and said, “What you wrote was
                            overwhelming; I am so proud of you!”

                            In her eyes was pride, and this had been eternally imprinted in my brain as the day that
                            motivated me to discover my passions and work towards them to positively impact people
                            around me and feel proud of myself. Later, the school converted my poem into a song which
                            was sung at our annual function. This new experience encouraged me to continue exploring and
                            learning.

                            Throughout middle school, I received much support and inspiration for my academic pursuits,
                            literary skills, and extracurricular activities. I reached 9th grade in the middle of a
                            pandemic during which I became more observant of the people around me and the various
                            actions that drove them to feel any emotion. Soon I decided to write a book that would be a
                            collection of poetry that dealt with various themes so people anywhere in the world could
                            connect with my poems offering a change in perspective & support.

                            The entire process was indeed challenging, where I had to meet academic deadlines and, at
                            the same time, edit, design, and compile the script for my book.

                            Finally, “Amidst The Downpour” was ready as a downpour of my thoughts and emotions over
                            paper. The honourable Governor of Madhya Pradesh agreed to inaugurate my book during the
                            book launch, and people from different educational fields and careers attended it.

                            Arayna Saxena has always been passionate about poetry writing and storytelling. She
                            describes herself as a curious Author who loves exploring different themes and motifs which
                            reflects in her poems. As part of her writing process, she loves immersing herself in her
                            work—diving headfirst into the research, production, and fine-tuning of the stories she
                            feels are the most worthy of telling.This book remains very close to her heart as it
                            comprises poems she has been writing and treasuring in a small notebook her mom gifted her
                            to now when she finally felt that her poems could be given a home in this book.
